Installation step by step

1. OS
Linux, Windows, and MAC OS are all supported.

2.Installation of OMNET++
https://omnetpp.org/
Installation Guild: https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf

notice: Dependencies are strong related, LOOK OUT!

e.g 
OS: Unbuntu 16.04
osgearth: 2.7
Java: openjdk8
OMNET++: 5.4.1
INet: 4.1.0
NeSTing

or 
OS: Unbuntu 18.04
osgearth: 2.10
Java: openjdk11
OMNET++: 5.5.1
INet: 4.1.2
NeSTing

3.INet
Install from OMNET++ Menu Help -> Install Simulation Models -> INet x.x.x

or
Download from OMNET++
  https://inet.omnetpp.org/
  or
  https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/releases

Extract the tgz file and move to 
  omnetpp-x.x.x/samples/
  rename inet4 to inet (all inet based code will #include "inet/xxxx.h")
DO NOT use inet4 and compile outside this fold, otherwise you will meet the compile error again and again.

Open OMNET++ IDE and choose omnetpp-x.x.x/samples/ as root, then you can right click the inet in Project Explore and choose build project.

4.NeSTing
Follow the guide of https://gitlab.com/ipvs/nesting 

or
Simply download the git with nesting-master.tar.gz from https://gitlab.com/ipvs/nesting
extract the 
  nesting-master.tar.gz 
and move to  
  omnetpp-x.x.x/samples/ 
and rename to 
  omnetpp-x.x.x/samples/nesting

Open OMNET++ IDE and choose omnetpp-x.x.x/samples/ as root, then you can right click the nesting in Project Explore and choose build project.

NOW, you can run the simulation with right click nesting in Project Explore, and choose 
  Run As or Debug As -> OMNeT++ Simulation

OMNeT++ will choose the right profile configuration and build to run the simuation.


After running the samples, you can program and add your own simulations for further research and development.
