THE MINNOWBOARD PROJECT IS BEING RETIRED
The MinnowBoard project launched more than six years ago to provide an open reference platform suitable for development from prototype to production. Since then, numerous alternatives have emerged for a range of projects. With such a rich set of alternatives available, we decided to cease ongoing development of new versions of the Minnowboard. This site will be active through December 31, 2019, after which tutorials and documentation will be available on github.com/MinnowBoard-org/. We thank the community for the support we have received over the years, and are pleased to see so many options for developers.

Thank you, -The MinnowBoard Team
