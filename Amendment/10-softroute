In case of local internet connection mismathcing, like somehow you CANNOT get suitable wifi or ethernet, or the address DOESNOT meet your demo requirement, you have to setup a local wireless router with local WiFi while Ethnernet connecting to Internet, or setup a local route with local Ethernet while  WiFi connecting to Internet.

Use your PC as a mobile hotspot
Turn your Windows 10 PC into a mobile hotspot by sharing your Internet connection with other devices over Wi-Fi. You can share a Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular data connection. If your PC has a cellular data connection and you share it, it will use data from your data plan.﻿

To enable Internet Connection Sharing in Windows 10, please follow the steps below:

1
Press Windows key + X to open the Power User menu and select Network Connections.
2
Right-click the network adapter with an Internet connection (Ethernet or wireless network adapter), then select Properties.  --Here, we choose wireless network adapter
3
Click Sharing.
4
Put a check mark on Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection.  
5
From the Home networking connection drop-down menu, select the Local Ethernet Adapter e.g. Ethernet0.  --Here, we choose local other Ethernet which connects local devices
6
Click OK to finish.


+IP addresses
So far, windows 10 will automatically allocate 192.168.137.1 subnet, to replace this, you cannot just simplely config the Local Ethernet Adapter -> Properties -> IPv4 -> IP address, instead, you should config regestration:
<Win>key + R
regedit

change two values:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters]
"ScopeAddress"="192.168.137.1" ->  "192.168.1.1"
"ScopeAddressBackup"="192.168.137.1" -> "192.168.1.1"


+Stability
Windows 10 ICS is not very stable, especially at startup after shutdown or sleep.
The only way to make it work again is to restart ICS:
1
Windows logo Start button , then select program Windows Management Tool -> Services 
2
choose "Internet Connection Sharing(ICS)"
3
right click and stop and restart if necessary 
4
Sometimes you have to disable the network adapter sharing and redo step by step from beginning to end again.

Wish you could working properly with softroute, and make peace for your life and work without troubled with these stupid and meaningless engineering stuffs.
